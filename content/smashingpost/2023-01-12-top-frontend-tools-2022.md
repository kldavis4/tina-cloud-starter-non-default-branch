Over the past 12 months, we continue to see new free and open-source projects shared around the developer community. In my newsletter, [Web Tools Weekly](https://webtoolsweekly.com/), I feature more than two dozen tools every week. As I do every year, I’ve gone through the numbers and put together what were the most popular tools according to my readers.

Some of these tools are interesting in a curious kind of way, but almost all of them are practical tools you can use in your projects today. I’ve listed these in reverse order of popularity based on unique clicks, so the most popular tools are at the bottom. Enjoy!

## [WebGi Camera Landing Page](https://github.com/ektogamat/camera-webgi)

[WebGi Camera Landing Page](https://github.com/ektogamat/camera-webgi) is a landing page template that uses GSAP, ScrollTrigger, and WebGI engine to create beautiful animated, scrollable one-page sites. The example website is impressive! It’s a mock Canon camera website with big graphics and animation.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://github.com/ektogamat/camera-webgi" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/cb37a6f3-7500-4446-bd5c-00c88b289ae4/01-webgicameralandingpage.png" width="800" height="502" sizes="100vw" caption="" alt="WebGi Camera Landing Page" >}}

Due to the potential for performance problems, this is obviously not for every kind of website. But it’s an option to consider if you want something bold and eye-catching.

## [CSS Fingerprint](https://csstracking.dev/)

Over the past few years, the concept of tracking users via nothing but CSS has been covered a lot. You can search the web for various articles on the topic, but [CSS Fingerprint](https://csstracking.dev/) is somewhat of an all-in-one resource on the subject.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://csstracking.dev/" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/2c2daaf7-ca43-4c92-9b24-1c339c7e6ce7/02-cssfingerprint.png" width="800" height="502" sizes="100vw" caption="" alt="CSS Fingerprint" >}}

You can agree to visit a test page where you can view your own "CSS fingerprint" and the associated GitHub repo has a little more technical info.

## [PostSrc Tailwind Components](https://postsrc.com/components)

Component libraries are always popular and anything associated with Tailwind tends to do well. [PostSrc Tailwind Components](https://postsrc.com/components) includes more than 50 components divided into more than a dozen categories.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://postsrc.com/components" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/734b3210-7cea-4f3d-ad8d-bccda9f6c9db/03-postsrctailwind.png" width="800" height="502" sizes="100vw" caption="" alt="PostSrc Tailwind Components" >}}

Includes components for UI elements like alerts, badges, buttons, breadcrumb navs, cards, CTAs, charts, forms, and more.

## [Almond.CSS](https://github.com/alvaromontoro/almond.css)

[Almond.CSS](https://github.com/alvaromontoro/almond.css) is the first of three "class-less" CSS frameworks that made this year’s list. Even with the popularity of utility libraries like Tailwind, it’s interesting to see these kinds of projects do so well.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://github.com/alvaromontoro/almond.css" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/142d6c77-a530-4fbf-919b-19829b927163/04-almondcss.png" width="800" height="502" sizes="100vw" caption="" alt="Almond.CSS" >}}

These libraries work similarly to a CSS reset or normalizer, but are a little more opinionated in terms of applied styles.

## [Piling.js](https://piling.js.org/)

[Piling.js](https://piling.js.org/) is a JavaScript library that allows you to build interfaces where large amounts of items can be dragged and dropped into "piles".

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://piling.js.org/" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/7de7f0fd-fbf7-4bfc-9780-a5c75781ea98/05-pilingjs.png" width="800" height="502" sizes="100vw" caption="" alt="Piling.js" >}}

## [Virgo](https://codyhouse.co/template/virgo)

[Virgo](https://codyhouse.co/template/virgo) is a free HTML template from the folks at CodyHouse. It’s compatible with CodyHouse’s own framework and Tailwind and doesn’t have any third-party dependencies out-of-the-box.

## [Onion](https://github.com/phparkle/onion)

[Onion](https://github.com/phparkle/onion) is a utility based on the most popular article on my personal blog. In that piece, I discuss a potential solution for [animating "display: none" to "display:block"](https://www.impressivewebs.com/animate-display-block-none/) in CSS, which isn’t technically possible.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://github.com/phparkle/onion" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/65708572-1da9-47e0-8e0e-55621b338312/07-onion.png" width="800" height="502" sizes="100vw" caption="" alt="Onion" >}}

My solution uses a little bit of JavaScript to mimic the effect. This project, built by Parkle Lee, encapsulates the code from that article into an easy-to-use JavaScript utility.

## [MingCute](https://www.mingcute.com/)

## [Scroll Btween](https://olivier3lanc.github.io/Scroll-Btween/)

[Scroll Btween](https://olivier3lanc.github.io/Scroll-Btween/) is sort of like a cross between an animation library and a parallax script. It allows you to 'tween' any CSS value for any element on the page relative to its position in the viewport.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://olivier3lanc.github.io/Scroll-Btween/" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/22387ba8-6897-42b3-9192-91a1788050ee/10-scrollbtween.png" width="800" height="502" sizes="100vw" caption="" alt="Scroll Btween" >}}

[Amigo CSS](https://amigocss.com/) is described as a "simple, custom-first and intuitive CSS framework" that’s tailored for beginners, building on some of the ideas present in other frameworks.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://amigocss.com/" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/e2ac6da0-d501-4a89-a076-46f08f00ff50/33-amigocss.png" width="800" height="502" sizes="100vw" caption="" alt="Amigo CSS" >}}

The framework encourages a custom class (which isn’t required) along with up to a maximum of seven utility classes per element. For the full details, check out the philosophy section of the website.

## [Hibiki HTML](https://www.hibikihtml.com/)

[Hibiki HTML](https://www.hibikihtml.com/) is an HTML-friendly JavaScript framework geared towards all levels of JavaScript developers and doesn’t require any boilerplate setup, scaffolding, build tools, and so on.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://www.hibikihtml.com/" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/03beb99e-079e-405b-ba9f-1c21c79e1599/34-hibikihtml.png" width="800" height="502" sizes="100vw" caption="" alt="Hibiki HTML" >}}

The main website includes an interactive tutorial and playground you can use to get accustomed to the syntax. Hibiki’s features are based around the use of the HTML `<template>` element, with concepts similar to popular libraries like Turbo and Hotwire.

## [Stylo](https://stylojs.com/)

Rich text editors that you can embed in a page or app are plenty and [Stylo](https://stylojs.com/) is the one in this category that made this year’s list. It has no dependencies, is framework agnostic, and can be customized to your app’s needs.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://stylojs.com/" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/173bd841-1c6a-408a-b0a3-8d30c595927f/35-stylojs.png" width="800" height="502" sizes="100vw" caption="" alt="Stylo" >}}

Try it out live on the page, it works smoothly and seems to be very user friendly.

## [CSS.GUI](https://components.ai/css-gui)

[CSS.GUI](https://components.ai/css-gui) is a free visual tool that’s CSS-based, to help you build components that you can export as HTML/CSS code.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://components.ai/css-gui" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/66bfbfef-81d7-41b0-b0e1-e2c8fa8e25f8/36-cssgui.png" width="800" height="502" sizes="100vw" caption="" alt="CSS.GUI" >}}

You can do just about anything you can do with raw CSS, including adding pseudo-elements, and you also get a tree view of the page’s HTML that allows you to easily select elements before customizing them.

## [Simple.css](https://simplecss.org/)

[Simple.css](https://simplecss.org/) is yet another option for a classless CSS framework that provides an attractive starting point for your HTML elements.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://simplecss.org/" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/1f0e9548-babb-4ec5-a038-fc4dac3afe7d/37-simplecss.png" width="800" height="502" sizes="100vw" caption="" alt="Simple.css" >}}

Similar to other classless frameworks, this one’s goal is to go beyond merely a reset or normalizer. It makes your elements look good by default without adding any extra bloat associated with larger frameworks.

## [Reasonable Colors](https://reasonable.work/colors/)

Select a color, after which you can choose your colors from the shades included for each. Choosing accessible colors is possible as long as there is a shade difference of 2 between the selections.

## [PlainAdmin](https://plainadmin.com/)

[PlainAdmin](https://plainadmin.com/) is a Bootstrap 5 admin dashboard template that includes 100+ UI components and 15+ HTML pages.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://plainadmin.com/" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/9c4f881d-2cf1-4b6f-a0f9-44c535f4b843/39-plainadmin.png" width="800" height="502" sizes="100vw" caption="" alt="PlainAdmin" >}}

There’s also a paid version with more components and features but the free version alone is a decent starting point for a solid dashboard template.

## [Meshy](https://meshgradient.in/)

[Meshy](https://meshgradient.in/) is a "mesh" gradient generator that includes a gallery of predefined mesh gradients, along with the ability to customize any of the gradient options. You can also randomize the "meshing" effect for any of the selected gradients, each of which uses 4 colors.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://meshgradient.in/" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/8f8a7904-7864-4f7e-8994-bd96cd1d2102/40-meshy.png" width="800" height="502" sizes="100vw" caption="" alt="Meshy" >}}

Any of the gradients can be downloaded in PNG format and the file can be sized to up to 3000x3000px for high resolution exports.

## [Bunny Fonts](https://fonts.bunny.net/)

[Bunny Fonts](https://fonts.bunny.net/) is a platform of open-source fonts that works as a drop-in replacement for Google Fonts. It has the same API format but with a focus on privacy and being GDPR-friendly.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://fonts.bunny.net/" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/f60a06b2-48b5-43b3-ab3c-bc7f86bdd0ac/41-bunnyfonts.png" width="800" height="502" sizes="100vw" caption="" alt="Bunny Fonts" >}}

The site works similarly to the Google Fonts UI and it currently includes over 1,400 fonts, about the same as the number available on Google Fonts.

## [Stylify](https://stylifycss.com/)

[Stylify](https://stylifycss.com/) is a library that generates optimized CSS based on syntax that’s identical to real CSS.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://stylifycss.com/" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/91316a5c-514c-4ce1-87e5-16d090b09a0e/42-stylify.png" width="800" height="502" sizes="100vw" caption="" alt="Stylify" >}}

The idea here is that your "classes" are actually CSS property/value pairs, then the library will generate the equivalent styles. This way you don’t have to learn the syntax of the framework, you simply use regular CSS.

## [Wanda](https://github.com/wonderflow-bv/wanda)

[Wanda](https://github.com/wonderflow-bv/wanda) is a design system from the team at Wonderflow that includes 40+ components along with a gallery of 360+ vector symbols.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://github.com/wonderflow-bv/wanda" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/39596b81-8317-4509-87d3-cdf827f0d8e2/43-wandadesign.png" width="800" height="502" sizes="100vw" caption="" alt="Wanda" >}}

The Wanda system has a focus on accessibility and the concept of form follows function. Both of these contribute to a set of UI components that are usable and accessible to as wide an audience as possible.

## [Symbols to Copy](https://symbols.wentin.net/)

[Symbols to Copy](https://symbols.wentin.net/) is a one-stop resource of copy/paste symbols to include in your websites, apps, or documentation.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://symbols.wentin.net/" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/20930428-4aa6-4735-8706-6a9d29b1e21e/44-symbolstocopy.png" width="800" height="502" sizes="100vw" caption="" alt="Symbols to Copy" >}}

Includes arrows, currency symbols, fractions, Latin and Greek letters, Math symbols, punctuation and more. I also like that you can click any symbol to get the full code info including Unicode, HTML entity, and more.

## [Open UI](https://open-ui.org/)

[Open UI](https://open-ui.org/) isn’t exactly a framework but an industry standard set of guidelines to define how developers can style and extend built-in web UI controls, such as checkboxes, radio buttons, select dropdowns, and so on.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://open-ui.org/" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/387198f2-7b11-467c-bc36-b6928a0655f1/45-openui.png" width="800" height="502" sizes="100vw" caption="" alt="Open UI" >}}

The idea behind the project is to create initiatives that help developers avoid having to reinvent the wheel in the library and framework space, but instead to encourage these components to move to universal standards that everyone can benefit from.

## [California Design System](https://designsystem.webstandards.ca.gov/)

The [California Design System](https://designsystem.webstandards.ca.gov/) is a resource for developers and designers building digital products in the state of California, in the U.S.A.

The design system includes principles, style guides, and components with guidelines on use, all for the benefit of filling the needs of customer-facing state websites in California.

## [Bamboo CSS](https://github.com/rilwis/bamboo)

This one includes crypto-based tools, conversion tools, miscellaneous web tools, image tools, and text tools. All the tools in this one are well-designed and easy to use.

{{% ad-panel-leaderboard %}}

## [Qwik](https://github.com/builderio/qwik)

[Qwik](https://github.com/builderio/qwik) is described as an "HTML-first" framework with performance at its core due to a small JavaScript footprint and on-demand component loading.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://github.com/builderio/qwik" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/4cc92b8c-32e3-4824-913c-eeec8906a399/49-qwik.png" width="800" height="502" sizes="100vw" caption="" alt="Qwik" >}}

## [Siimple](https://siimple.xyz/)

[Siimple](https://siimple.xyz/) is a CSS toolkit, or framework, that includes lots of modules, components, and helpers. The components come with a default minimal design that can easily be customized.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://siimple.xyz/" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/f135a55e-d9ea-4494-b8ac-e710dfbebee7/50-siimple.png" width="800" height="502" sizes="100vw" caption="" alt="Siimple" >}}

The name is based on its simplicity of use by means of official presets and the ability to easily customize colors, fonts, sizes, design accents, and lots more.

## [Lorem Faces](https://loremfaces.com/)

[Lorem Faces](https://loremfaces.com/) is a gallery of free AI-generated photos of people that you can use for mockups and as design placeholders.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://loremfaces.com/" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/2ac553d4-7e02-45f7-b5c5-acc204190ada/51-loremfaces.png" width="800" height="502" sizes="100vw" caption="" alt="Lorem Faces" >}}

You can choose square, rounded, or circular photos and color, greyscale, or sepia for the image’s tone.

## [HTTP Status Dogs](https://httpstatusdogs.com/)

[HTTP Status Dogs](https://httpstatusdogs.com/) is a gallery of HTTP status codes each matched with an appropriate dog photo. You can use these for your own site or apps status messages if you like.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://httpstatusdogs.com/" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/355712f1-b68f-4454-9ea5-995db90adc0d/52-httpstatusdogs.png" width="800" height="502" sizes="100vw" caption="" alt="HTTP Status Dogs" >}}

There have been similar projects like this one in the past, but this one includes a few more status codes and many of the matching photos are quite humourous!

## [Clay.css](https://codeadrian.github.io/clay.css/)

[Clay.css](https://codeadrian.github.io/clay.css/) is a CSS utility for adding a claymorphism style to page elements. This is definitely not going to be used on many projects, but the effect is nice and might come in handy in a children’s project or something else that requires a fun and informal look.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://codeadrian.github.io/clay.css/" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/82bd5635-4d2b-4c83-8426-d1104c8a1567/53-claycss.png" width="800" height="502" sizes="100vw" caption="" alt="Clay.css" >}}

You can include and customize the styles using a utility class, CSS variables, or by means of a Sass mixin.

## [john-doe](https://github.com/cadars/john-doe)

[john-doe](https://github.com/cadars/john-doe) is a concept for a one-page website that was first put out in late 2020, but I only came across it this past year. The idea behind this one is the use of CSS’s `:target` pseudo-class, which allows you to display different page content based on hash URLs (e.g. `#home`, `#about`, `#contact`, etc) and IDs on page elements.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://github.com/cadars/john-doe" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/4a2dc30c-6c17-4a26-ab88-afd68d3b8e2d/54-johndoe.png" width="800" height="502" sizes="100vw" caption="" alt="john-doe" >}}

The only drawback to this method is the fact that search engines generally don’t recognize hash-based URL changes as separate pages. So this is a novelty-type thing that you probably wouldn’t use on anything important.

## [Mdash](https://m-docs.org/)

[Mdash](https://m-docs.org/) is a UI library of components that’s 100% standards-based. The components are all based on HTML and Custom Elements and thus can work along with any web framework.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://m-docs.org/" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/7ea5a413-f929-4862-8d15-abcdec589409/55-mdash.png" width="800" height="502" sizes="100vw" caption="" alt="Mdash" >}}

Many of the components are simply pure HTML with some sensible defaults, while others are a little more interactive depending on the component.

## [Preline UI](https://preline.co/)

[Preline UI](https://preline.co/) is an open-source set of ready-to-use components built on Tailwind CSS. It’s a huge collection of more than 250 components compatible with React and Vue or a plain HTML + Tailwind project.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://preline.co/" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/b015409f-68ea-4a8e-8390-82db61389cf0/56-preline.png" width="800" height="502" sizes="100vw" caption="" alt="Preline UI" >}}

All components include dark mode and there are base components (buttons, lists, etc.), navigation components, form components, overlays, and tables. All components are beautifully designed and the docs are quite extensive in demonstrating the different ways the components can be used.

## [UI Buttons](https://ui-buttons.web.app/)

[UI Buttons](https://ui-buttons.web.app/) is a unique collection of 100 buttons that feature styles and hover effects you may not have seen elsewhere.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://ui-buttons.web.app/" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/6dfe2283-b52b-41e6-8ff3-b55ea6e5b7d7/57-uibuttons.png" width="800" height="502" sizes="100vw" caption="" alt="UI Buttons" >}}

The CSS for each button is easy to grab and you can easily customize the colors and overall look while maintaining the interactive effects.

## [AgnosticUI](https://www.agnosticui.com/)

[AgnosticUI](https://www.agnosticui.com/) is a set of framework-agnostic UI components that work in React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, and vanilla JavaScript.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://www.agnosticui.com/" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/efb2ae96-67a9-4d63-8c5c-72b1f773d60e/58-agnosticui.png" width="800" height="502" sizes="100vw" caption="" alt="AgnosticUI" >}}

The components allow customization and theming via CSS custom properties and include about 30 common UI patterns along with guidelines for use in the different frameworks or as pure CSS.

## [TimelineJS](https://timeline.knightlab.com/)

[TimelineJS](https://timeline.knightlab.com/) is an open-source JavaScript library and spreadsheet tool that allows you to embed an interactive timeline component on a web page.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://timeline.knightlab.com/" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/0c9e31fe-ff57-43da-abdc-44ee8ad97cd9/59-timelinejs.png" width="800" height="502" sizes="100vw" caption="" alt="TimelineJS" >}}

You can build the timeline based on data from a Google Sheet template that the site provides, then you can generate the timeline by entering the URL to your sheet. There’s also the option to use JSON as the data source, which would be more privacy-friendly.

## [JSON Crack](https://jsoncrack.com/)

And finally, [JSON Crack](https://jsoncrack.com/) was the most popular tool of year according to the unique click stats in my newsletter. This was originally referred to as "JSON Visio" and it’s a visualization tool and formatter for your JSON data.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://jsoncrack.com/" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/b013e821-b71a-4fdb-a276-f18c3295c99b/60-jsoncrack.png" width="800" height="502" sizes="100vw" caption="" alt="JSON Crack" >}}

Paste your data into the editor and the tool will display it in an easy-to-read flowchart format that you can customize or even embed on your own pages. There’s a search feature to find data in large files and there’s an associated VS Code extension.
