## Japanese Design

The web spans the entire globe, however, when we talk about web design, the examples usually revolve around the 26 characters of the Latin alphabet. Other writing systems are often not part of the discussion — with the effect that a lot of brilliant websites stay unnoticed for a lot of us. Time to change that. If you’re up for a journey through Japanese web design, [Responsive Web Design JP](https://responsive-jp.com/) is for you. The examples in the collection shine with a **unique lightness** and concentration on the essential, and, even if you don’t master Japanese, you can browse the showcase by technique.

## Design Made In Germany

Apart from covering website design, there are also collections featuring stellar pieces of **brand design**, print design, packaging, logos, posters, movies, typefaces, and illustrations.

## Dark Mode Design

[Dark Mode Design](https://www.darkmodedesign.com/) showcases beautifully designed websites that are either exclusively in dark mode or have the ability to switch. Wonderful examples that dark mode is not an add-on to a “regular” light design but a style with lots of **creative possibilities**.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://www.darkmodedesign.com/" src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/web-design-inspiration-roundup/darkmode-design-opt.png" width="800" height="423" sizes="100vw" caption="Dark Mode is more than what’s hiding behind the toggle, as <a href='https://www.darkmodedesign.com/'>Dark Mode Design</a> shows.

## Minimal Design

Dominic Whittle and Tom Fitzgerald, curators of [Httpster](https://httpster.net/), love good typography and **effective, unpretentious design**. More than ten years ago, they started emailing links of nice sites to each other but quickly realized that they needed a better system for sharing and tagging the things they get inspired by. That’s when Httpster was born.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://httpster.net/" src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/web-design-inspiration-roundup/httpster-opt.png" width="800" height="427" sizes="100vw" caption="Good typography and effective designs are at the heart of the <a href='https://httpster.net/'>Httpster</a> showcase.

## Low-Carbon Websites

With big JavaScript libraries, large unoptimized images, and auto-playing videos, many incredible websites are heavier than they could be, creating a large, hidden carbon footprint. And then there are websites that prove that good design can also be achieved while keeping the carbon impact on the planet low. [Lowwwcarbon](https://lowwwcarbon.com/) features examples of **sustainably built, low-impact websites**. And if that’s not enough inspiration yet, [Lowww](https://lowww.directory/) is also dedicated to sustainable web design.
