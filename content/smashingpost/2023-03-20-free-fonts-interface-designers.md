Not every project has the budget to spend a lot of money on fonts. But that doesn‚Äôt mean that typography needs to play a secondary role when the budget is tight. The variety and quality of free and open-source fonts out there is impressive and enables everyone to use **beautiful, well-crafted typefaces**.

In this post, we compiled some free fonts that we came across and that you probably haven‚Äôt spotted before. Some of them shine with their flexibility, some put a special focus on readability, and others are a great choice if you want to make a bold statement. As different as the fonts are, they all have one thing in common: You can use them for free in both **personal and commercial projects**. A huge thank-you to the wonderful type designers and contributors for making their fonts available to all of us! üëèüèºüëèüèΩüëèüèæ 

## Recursive

Built to maximize versatility, control, and performance, [Recursive](https://www.recursive.design/) is a five-axis variable font that can go from Sans to Mono. Taking full advantage of variable font technology, it gives you **full flexibility**. 

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://www.recursive.design/" src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/open-source-fonts-roundup/recursive-opt.png" width="800" height="507" sizes="100vw" caption="<a href='https://www.recursive.design/'>Recursive</a> takes full advantage of variable font technology to give you maximum flexibility. (Image credit: <a href='https://www.recursive.design/'>Recursive</a>)" alt="Recursive" >}}

Recursive allows you to choose from a wide range of predefined styles or dial in exactly what you want for each of its axes: Monospace, Casual, Weight, Slant, and Cursive. Inspiration came from single-stroke casual signpainting to give the font a flexible and warmly energetic look, making it a great fit for data-rich-apps, technical documentation, code editors, and much more. Designed by Stephen Nixon, with contributions from Lisa Huang, Katja Schimmel, Rafa≈Ç Buchner, and Cris R HernaÃÅndez.

## Yrsa &amp; Rasa

The type families [Yrsa and Rasa](http://github.rosettatype.com/yrsa-rasa/) have a different approach than other type projects. They build upon the existing typefaces Merriweather and Skolar Gujarati to produce two entirely new type families that span **different writing systems**.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="http://github.rosettatype.com/yrsa-rasa/" src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/open-source-fonts-roundup/yrsa-rasa-opt.png" width="800" height="502" sizes="100vw" caption="<a href='http://github.rosettatype.com/yrsa-rasa/'>Yrsa & Rasa</a> are intended for continuous reading on the web ‚Äî for Latin and Gujarati scripts. (Image credit: <a href='http://github.rosettatype.com/yrsa-rasa/'>Yrsa & Rasa</a>)" alt="Yrsa & Rasa" >}}

Yrsa supports over 92 languages in Latin script and has a special focus on properly shaping the accents in Central and East European languages. Rasa supports a wide array of basic and compound syllables used in Gujarati. Both type families include five weights and are intended for continuous reading on the web. Perfect for longer articles in online news, magazines, or blogs. Designed by Anna Giedry≈õ and David B≈ôezina.

## Space Grotesk

[Space Grotesk](https://fonts.floriankarsten.com/space-grotesk) is a proportional sans-serif typeface variant based on Colophon Foundry‚Äôs fixed-width Space Mono family. It retains the idiosyncratic details of the monospace while optimizing for **improved readability** of non-display sizes.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://fonts.floriankarsten.com/space-grotesk" src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/open-source-fonts-roundup/space-grotesk-opt.png" width="800" height="464" sizes="100vw" caption="<a href='https://fonts.floriankarsten.com/space-grotesk'>Space Grotesk</a> is a four-weight proportional version of the original Space Mono open-source font. (Image credit: <a href='https://fonts.floriankarsten.com/space-grotesk'>Space Grotesk</a>)" alt="Space Grotesk" >}}

Space Grotesk includes four weights and open-type features like old-style and tabular figures, superscript and subscript numerals, fractions, and stylistic alternates. Latin Vietnamese, Pinyin, and all Western, Central, and South-Eastern European languages are supported. Designed by Kvƒõtoslav Barto≈° for Florian Karsten Typefaces.

## Figtree

[Figtree](https://www.erikdkennedy.com/projects/figtree.html) combines **friendly curved shapes**, a simple monolinear construction, a high x-height, and slight taper into a charming geometric typeface that ensures maximum readability.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://www.erikdkennedy.com/projects/figtree.html" src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/open-source-fonts-roundup/figtree-opt.png" width="800" height="412" sizes="100vw" caption="<a href='https://www.erikdkennedy.com/projects/figtree.html'>Figtree</a> is a geometric sans-serif font walking the line between simplicity and friendliness. (Image credit: <a href='https://www.erikdkennedy.com/projects/figtree.html'>Figtree</a>)" alt="Figtree" >}}

Figtree comes in seven weights, ranging from Light to Black, and includes typographic finesses such as fractions, monospace numbers, and scientific inferiors. Minimal but not stiff, casual but not silly, the typeface beautifully manages to maintain a crisp, clean feeling. Designed by Erik Kennedy.

## Reforma

[Reforma](https://pampatype.com/reforma) is a versatile font family designed for **long-form reading**. Commissioned to celebrate the centenary of the university reform of the Universidad Nacional de C√≥rdoba, Argentina, the typeface had to convey four premises: plurality, intellectual heritage, versatility, and free availability.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://pampatype.com/reforma" src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/open-source-fonts-roundup/reforma-opt.png" width="800" height="523" sizes="100vw" caption="<a href='https://pampatype.com/reforma'>Reforma</a> includes 20 font styles that work harmoniously in different contexts. (Image credit: <a href='https://pampatype.com/reforma'>Reforma</a>)" alt="Reforma" >}}

After three years of work, 20 font styles were born that work harmoniously in different contexts. They are grouped into three subfamilies ‚Äî from a classic serif to a modern sans-serif and an intermediate hybrid style with flare serifs ‚Äî and are available in three weights plus an ultra-black companion set for headings. Reforma beautifully manages to strike the balance between tradition and novelty while staying super-versatile. Designed by Alejandro Lo Celso, Jorge Ivan Moreno Majul, Francisco Galvez Pizarro, Francis Ramel, and Oscar Ya√±ez.

## Hanken Grotesk

If you‚Äôre looking for a versatile sans-serif typeface inspired by the classic grotesques, [Hanken Grotesk](https://hanken.co/products/hanken-grotesk) might be right down your alley. It shines with a friendly, distinguishable look and is equally suitable for **small text and headings**.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Hanken+Grotesk" src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/open-source-fonts-roundup/hanken-grotesk-opt.png" width="800" height="370" sizes="100vw" caption="Inspired by classic grotesques, <a href='https://hanken.co/products/hanken-grotesk'>Hanken Grotesk</a> works well in a wide range of projects.

## Grenze

[Grenze](https://www.omnibus-type.com/fonts/Grenze/) combines the best of two worlds. As a **hybrid** between Roman and Blackletter styles, it transports a sense of boldness and texture while at the same time offering the readability of classical typefaces.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://www.omnibus-type.com/fonts/Grenze/" src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/open-source-fonts-roundup/grenze-opt.png" width="800" height="505" sizes="100vw" caption="<a href='https://www.omnibus-type.com/fonts/Grenze/'>Grenze</a> is a hybrid development between Roman and Blackletter styles. (Image credit: <a href='https://www.omnibus-type.com/fonts/Grenze/'>Grenze</a>)" alt="Grenze" >}}

The family includes nine weights (Thin, Extra Light, Light, Regular, Medium, Semibold, Bold, Extra Bold, and Black) with matching italics. To respond to different needs, Grenze comes with some useful advanced features such as ligatures, ornaments, extended language support, and various figure sets. Designed by Renata Polastri and the Omnibus team.

## Fira Sans

Originally designed as a system font for Mozilla‚Äôs FirefoxOS, the humanist sans-serif [Fira Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Sans) grew into a **versatile** open-source typeface that stays readable across screen qualities and sizes.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Sans" src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/open-source-fonts-roundup/fira-sans-opt.png" width="800" height="423" sizes="100vw" caption="<a href='https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Sans'>Fira Sans</a> shines with its versatility and readability. (Image credit: <a href='https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Sans'>Fira Sans</a>)" alt="Fira Sans" >}}

Fira Sans is available in 18 styles, including nine weights and accompanying italics. The package also includes a [mono-spaced variant](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Mono). Designed by Carrois Apostrophe in cooperation with Erik Spiekermann.

## Atkinson Hyperlegible

Certain letters and numbers can be hard to distinguish from one another for low-vision readers. [Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont) is here to change that. Named after Braille Institute founder J. Robert Atkinson, the typeface focuses on **letterform distinction** to increase character recognition and improve readability.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont" src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/open-source-fonts-roundup/atkinson-hyperlegible-opt.png" width="800" height="517" sizes="100vw" caption="Designed by the Braille Institute of America, <a href='https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont'>Atkinson Hyperlegible</a> puts a special focus on letterform distinction to improve readability for low-vision readers. (Image credit: <a href='https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont'>Atkinson Hyperlegible</a>)" alt="Atkinson Hyperlegible" >}}

Recognizable footprints, differentiated letterforms, unambiguous characters, and exaggerated forms are some of the techniques that optimize readability and give the typeface its distinctive look. Atkinson Hyperlegible includes four fonts, with two weights (Regular, Bold, Italics, Italics Bold). Thanks to accent characters, 27 languages are supported. Designed by Braille Institute of America.

## Anek

The multi-script typeface [Anek](https://design.google/library/anek-multiscript/) tells a very special story. It covers **nine Indian languages** plus Latin and was created through a collaboration of twelve type designers working across eight cities in India. The design of each script is deeply rooted in its typographic culture, while the different scripts live together in visual harmony.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://design.google/library/anek-multiscript/" src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/open-source-fonts-roundup/anek-opt.png" width="800" height="396" sizes="100vw" caption="A collaboration of twelve type designers, <a href='https://design.google/library/anek-multiscript/'>Anek</a> covers nine Indian languages. (Image credit: <a href='https://design.google/library/anek-multiscript/'>Anek</a>)" alt="Anek" >}}

All Anek fonts share visual similarities like circles and circular shapes, robust letter structures, and delicate joineries. With 40 styles per set, Anek is one of the few Indian variable display fonts with such a large set of weight and width styles. Designed by Sarang Kulkarni, Girish Dalvi, Noopur Datye, Hanif Kureshi, Maithili Shingre, Yashodeep Gholap, Divya Kowshik, Aadarsh Rajan, and Shuchita Grover.

## Source Sans

Designed by Paul D. Hunt, [Source Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro) is Adobe‚Äôs first open-source typeface family. The sans-serif draws inspiration from classic grotesques and is characterized by a **visual simplicity** that works equally well in long-form texts just like as short labels in user interfaces.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro" src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/open-source-fonts-roundup/source-sans-opt.png" width="800" height="398" sizes="100vw" caption="<a href='https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro'>Source Sans</a> works equally well for long-form reading and UI copy.

## Disket Mono

Monospace fonts often have a technical feel to them, waking connotations of coding editors or typewriters. [Disket Mono](https://rostype.com/disket/) is a bit different. The font strikes a **perfect balance** between the inspiration it draws from geometry, grids, and architecture and using soft corners for a more tactile, personal feel.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://rostype.com/disket/" src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/open-source-fonts-roundup/disket-mono-opt.png" width="800" height="390" sizes="100vw" caption="Soft corners give the geometric <a href='https://rostype.com/disket/'>Disket Mono</a> a tactile feel. (Image credit: <a href='https://rostype.com/disket/'>Disket Mono</a>)" alt="Disket Mono" >}}
 
Disket Mono comes in two weights (Regular and Bold) and supports twenty languages. A beautiful display font, designed by Mariano Diez.

## Srbija Sans

[Srbija Sans](https://www.srbijasans.rs/) is a neo-grotesque sans-serif typeface with a geometric look. It gets by without any decorative details, but when you look more closely, you‚Äôll notice how small design decisions improve readability and give the clear shapes a **warm and natural touch**.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://www.srbijasans.rs/" src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/open-source-fonts-roundup/srbija-sans-opt.png" width="800" height="393" sizes="100vw" caption="<a href='https://www.srbijasans.rs/'>Srbija Sans</a> supports Latin and Cyrillic.

## The League Of Moveable Type

[The League of Moveable Type](https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/) opened its doors back in 2009 when designers were just gaining the ability to put custom fonts on the web. The project‚Äôs mission has stayed the same since day one: to **raise the design standards** of the web.
